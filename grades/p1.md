|presentation|3|5|poor lessons for the next phase|

**additional comments**:

- some points are a little too vague
    - **Priority and/or difficulty of user stories**
        - what would be considered a "core functionality"?
        - `how long it would take to implement and how much thinking it requires` (you need to define what this is)
            - how to you measure "how much thinking" something requires?
    - **Division of work**
        - too basic; there are no real strategies to divide work
            - how do you assign tickets to each group member?
            - how do you quantify how much work each ticket is?
                - what if someone gets a bunch of easy tickets and someone else gets a couple hard tickets?
    - would have liked to see more scrum methodologies
    - would have liked to see more tools other than just Discord
- lessons for the next phase was not well done
    - not even a real lesson
    - too vague

## additional comments

- most of your pages are not very orgainzed
    - apparent that different people worked on different pages
    - have someone go over all your deliverables at the end to make the formatting and style consistent across all files
- most of your points are too general or too vague
    - you need to explain your points in more detail to get full marks
        - writing a single sentence for each point is not sufficient
